So, I got to Coe HQ around 7:45a on Saturday morning
- wouldn't recommend going any sooner,
since the Ranger wasn't around until about 8.
When I asked for a permit,
I was told Mississippi Lake, where I planned to stay that night,
was "wide open". We'll see about that...

The permit ended up being $8 or $12 or something.
I paid, asked about ticks and water, and was off.
